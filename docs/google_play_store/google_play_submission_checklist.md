## Notes on Subscription Implementation

For AdGenius AI, we're using PayPal as the primary payment processor, but we need to ensure compliance with Google Play's policies:

1. **Google Play Billing Integration**:
   - For app installs from Google Play, we must offer Google Play billing as an option
   - We can offer PayPal as an alternative payment method, but Google Play billing must be available

2. **Service Fee Considerations**:
   - Google charges a service fee for payments processed through Google Play billing
   - Plan for this in the financial model

3. **Dual Payment System**:
   - Our app needs to handle both PayPal and Google Play subscription management
   - Users should be able to manage their subscription regardless of payment method
