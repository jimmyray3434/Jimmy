## Design Guidelines

### Visual Style
- Use the app's actual UI with real data (not placeholder text)
- Ensure text is legible and important elements are clearly visible
- Maintain consistent lighting and color scheme across all screenshots
- Use the app's primary color palette (blues and purples) for any added elements

### Text Overlays
- Keep text overlays minimal and focused on key benefits
- Use the app's primary font for consistency
- Ensure high contrast between text and background
- Position text so it doesn't obscure important UI elements

### Highlighting Features
- Use subtle highlights or circles to draw attention to key features
- Consider using arrows or indicators to guide the viewer's eye
- Avoid cluttering the screenshot with too many callouts

## Production Process

1. Set up demo accounts with sample data that looks realistic and impressive
2. Configure each screen to showcase the feature in its best light
3. Take screenshots using a device or emulator at the required resolutions
4. Add text overlays and visual enhancements using graphic design software
5. Review for consistency, legibility, and impact
